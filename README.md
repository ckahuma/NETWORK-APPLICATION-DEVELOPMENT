# NAD_PROJECT_1
This project is based on the Java programming language, to develop a Register and Login system using servlets.
The system enables a client to register their details through a regitration form, which are then placed into the database when the person has successfully registered. It then redirects them to the login page(provided they sucessfully registered) where they can enter their login credentials. If they are valid users as per the authentication servlet, they are successfully logged in and redirected to a sucess page, but if they are invalid users, they are redirected to an error page that gives them an opportunity to renter their login credentials.
